# Extreme-Learning-Machine
Extreme Learning Machine is a very fast way of training a Neural Network, it uses the Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse to calculate the weights with the minimun error. 

This code presents:
- This is a simple function for fin de input weights, output weights and de biases of a ELM neural netwok
- The main activation function is the sigmoidal function
- Its parameters are: input and target of identification and input and target of testing and the number of neurons
- Data must be column vectors
